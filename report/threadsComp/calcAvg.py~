Testing how many threads is optimal. 
Time was taken from before threads start to right before we disconnect from _hlaWorld.

"the lists contain the total time (ms) it took N threads to calculate 39800 x 100 paths, the average time is ..."

- BLOCK_SIZE: 1
- threads: 1 .. 
- Radio l=0.002
- MAX_HOPS=4
- 39800 requests
- 200 noder
- distance heur
- randomized radioCom (but same resulting graph)
